# Capy

> A graph database built for verifiable, content addressable, linked data. 

Capy makes it super easy to build local-first, peer-to-peer, and distributed applications. Define your schemas in GraphQL and use your favorite GraphQL client to create and query data. Export your data to Filecoin for permanent storage or connect to IPFS for multiplayer applications.
